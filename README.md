The Spider Queen Mod
=========================

The Spider Queen was a popular Minecraft mod that met its demise after the largely mod-breaking 1.3 update of Minecraft.

A short history - the Spider Queen has been through a few iterations since Minecraft 1.3, those being:
- Spider Queen (by djoslin, original)
- Spider Queen Redux (by lemonszz)
- Spider Queen Reborn (by WildBamaBoy, from scratch)
- Spider Queen (by WildBamaBoy using djoslin's version as a base)

Spider Queen reverses the role of the player in Minecraft by placing them in the role of a monster instead of a human. 
As the Spider Queen, you will be able to see better in the dark, catch monsters and humans, and use them to create new spiders that will protect you from danger! 

Use webbing to climb walls, catch monsters and animals, and even create a webslinger to swing from the walls and ceilings! 
Use the Spider Rod to command your army and move them from place to place.

Explore the darkness to your heart's content. Make friends with the skeletons, creepers, and zombies by giving them hearts, skulls, and brains. Befriend the creatures of the night!

Battle roving bands of humans, or be friends with them. Create an army and a family! Be a monster today.
